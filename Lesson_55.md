### Recent developments in astronomy have made it possible to detect planets in our own Milky Way and in other galaxies.  
  
detect v. to discover or notice sth, especially sth that is not easy to see, hear, etc.  
  
The tests are disigned to detect the disease early.  
  
an instrument that can detect small amounts of radiation  
  
the Milky Way = the Galaxy 银河  
  
### This is a major achievement because, in relative terms, planets are very small and do not e'mit light.  
  
in relative terms: compared with other, similar things  
Students have less money in relative terms, but spend more on books.  
  
### Finding planets is proving har enough, but finding life on them will prove infinitely more difficult.  
  
prove (to be) + adj. / n.

### The first question to answer is whether a planet can actually support life.  
  
support v. to provide the right conditions, such as enough food and water, for life  
  
The land is so poor here that it cannot support any crops.  
Because of pollution, this lake is now too acid to support fish.  
  
### In our own solar system, for example, Venus is far too hot and Mars is far too cold to support life.  
  
### Only the Earth provides ideal conditions, and even here it has taken more than 4 billion years for plant and animal life to evolve.  
  
it takes ... (for...) to do sth.  
It took a few minutes for his eyes to adjust to the dark.  
  
It can take as long as eight days to rig up rope ladders and to establish supply bases before a descent can be made into a very deep cave.  
  
### Whether a planet can support life depends on the size and brightness of its star, that is its 'sun'.  
  
that is (to say): or more exactly  
The fare is reduced for children, that is anyoneunder 15 years old.  
Languages are taught by the direct method, that is to say, without using the student's own language.  
  
One authority on spiders made a census of the spiders in a grass field in the south of England, and he estimated that there were more than 2,250,000 in one acre, that is something like 6,000,000 spiders of different kinds on a football pitch.  
  
The film is only open to adults, i.e. peple over 18.

up to sth.  
1. 多达

2. = up till  
Up to the time of his death, Richard Colson was one of the most notable figures in our town.  
  
Up to now, historians have assumed that calendars came into being with the advent of agriculture, for then man was faced with a real need to understand something about the seasons.  
  
### A planet would have to be a very long way from it to be capable of supporting life.  
  
### Alternatively, if the star were small, the life-supporting planet would have to have a close orbit round it and (would) also (have to) provide the perfect conditions for life forms to develop.  
  
alternatively adv. used to introduce a suggestion or to mention sth. different to what has just been stated  
  
The agency will make travel arrangements for you. Alternatively, you can organize your own transport.

### But how would we find such a planet if there were such a planet?  
  
### At present, there is no telescope in existence that is capable of detecting the presence of life.

2. used with some names to make adjectives describing the main substance in a product

### Our own warm atmosphere and the heat generated by the telescope would make it impossible to detect objects as small as planets.  
  
### Even a telescope in orbit round the earth, like the very successful Hubble telescope, would not be suitable because of the dust particles in our solar system.  
  
Hubble Edwin Powell: American astronomer who discovered that the velocities of nebulae increase with distance  
  
Hubble Space Telescope (HST)  
The Hubble Space Telescope is a telescope in orbit aroung the Earth.  
  
Its position outside the Earth's atmosphere allows it to take extremely sharp images, and since its launch in 1990, it has become one of the most important telescopes in the history of astronomy.  
  
It has been responsible for many ground-breaking observations and has helped astronomers achieve a better understanding of many fundamental problems in astrophysics.  
  
particle n. a very small piece of sth.  
dust particles  
tiny particles of soil  
  
elementary particle n. one of the types of pieces of matter including electrons, protons, and neutrons that make up atoms

They became (the hungrier) the harder they worked.  
  
We are so familiar with the fact that man ages, that people have for years assumed that the people have for years assumed that the process of losing vigour with time, of becoming more likely to die the older we get, was something self-evident, like the cooling of a hot kettle or the wearing-out of a pair of shoes.  
  
### Once we detected a planet, we would have to find a way of blotting out the light from its star, so that we would be able to 'see' the planet properly and analyze its atmosphere.
