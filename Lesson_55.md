### Recent developments in astronomy have made it possible to detect planets in our own Milky Way and in other galaxies.

The tests are disigned to detect the disease early.  
  
an instrument that can detect small amounts of radiation

### This is a major achievement because, in relative terms, planets are very small and do not e'mit light.  
  
in relative terms: compared with other, similar things

### Finding planets is proving har enough, but finding life on them will prove infinitely more difficult.

The land is so poor here that it cannot support any crops.  
Because of pollution, this lake is now too acid to support fish.  
  
### In our own solar system, for example, Venus is far too hot and Mars is far too cold to support life.  
  
### Only the Earth provides ideal conditions, and even here it has taken more than 4 billion years for plant and animal life to evolve.  
  
it takes ... (for...) to do sth.  
It took a few minutes for his eyes to adjust to the dark.  
  
It can take as long as eight days to rig up rope ladders and to establish supply bases before a descent can be made into a very deep cave.  
  
### Whether a planet can support life depends on the size and brightness of its star, that is its 'sun'.  
  
that is (to say): or more exactly

Languages are taught by the direct method, that is to say, without using the student's own language.  
  
One authority on spiders made a census of the spiders in a grass field in the south of England, and he estimated that there were more than 2,250,000 in one acre, that is something like 6,000,000 spiders of different kinds on a football pitch.

### A planet would have to be a very long way from it to be capable of supporting life.  
  
### Alternatively, if the star were small, the life-supporting planet would have to have a close orbit round it and (would) also (have to) provide the perfect conditions for life forms to develop.  
  
alternatively adv. used to introduce a suggestion or to mention sth. different to what has just been stated
